            <ol>
                <li><p>Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stove top over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.</p></li>
                <li><p>Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.</p></li>
                <li><p>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</p></li>
                <li><p>Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.</p></li>
                <li><p>Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.</p></li>
